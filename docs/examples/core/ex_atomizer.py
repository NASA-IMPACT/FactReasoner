    This mission was significant as it marked the third time humans set \
    foot on the lunar surface, with astronauts Alan Shepard and Edgar \
    Mitchell joining Captain Stuart Roosa, who had previously flown on \
    Apollo 13. The mission lasted for approximately 8 days, during which \

    been invaluable for scientific research ever since."
