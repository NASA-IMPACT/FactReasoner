INSTRUCTION_ATOMIZER = """
Instructions:
Your task is to break down a given paragraph into a set of atomic units without adding any new information.

Rules:
- An atomic unit is the smallest sentence containing a singular piece of information directly extracted from the provided paragraph.
- Atomic units may contradict one another.
- The paragraph may contain information that is factually incorrect. Even in such cases, you are not to alter any information contained in the paragraph and must produce atomic units that are completely faithful to the information in the paragraph.
- Each atomic unit in the output must check a different piece of information found explicitly in the paragraph.
- Each atomic unit is standalone in that any actual nouns or proper nouns should be used in place of pronouns or anaphors.
- Each atomic unit must not include any information beyond what is explicitly stated in the provided paragraph.
- Where possible, avoid paraphrasing and instead try to only use language used in the paragraph without introducing new words. 
- The output must be a JSON dictionary with the following format and markdown code fences such that each atomic unit has a unique ID:

```json
{
    "id1": "<first atomic unit>",
    "id2": "<second atomic unit>",
    ...
}
```

Use the provided examples to learn your task.

Example 1:
INPUT: Glenn Allen Anzalone (born June 23, 1955), better known by his stage name Glenn Danzig, is an American singer, songwriter, musician, and record producer.

Example 4:
INPUT: I'm here to help you make an informed decision. Both the RTX 3060 Ti and RTX 3060 are powerful GPUs, and the difference between them lies in their performance. The RTX 3060 Ti has more CUDA cores (4864 vs 3584) but a lower boost clock speed (1665 MHz vs 1777 MHz) compared to the RTX 3060. In terms of memory bandwidth, the RTX 3060 Ti has a slight edge over the RTX 3060 with a bandwidth of 448 GB/s compared to 360 GB/s. However, the difference is relatively small. It's important to consider other factors such as the power consumption, cooling system, and compatibility with your system when making a decision."
